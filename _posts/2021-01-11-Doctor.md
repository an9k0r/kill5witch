## WebServer/VHOST Port 80 (manual - no tools)

Checking the webserver an Email info@doctors.htb was found therefore the domain doctors.htb was put into /etc/hosts. Nothing else was found.

### GOBUSTER

Gobuster was able to find few pages.

## WebServer/VHOST Port 8089 - splunkd (manual - no tools)

It shows splunk tools but they need a login.

# EXPLOITATION

## Registering on doctors.htb

After putting doctors.htb to /etc/hosts and visiting it, page automatically redirects to login portal where we can login or/and register. So let's register:

## Path Traversal (no exploitation)

We can view other users posts but it is nothing there

## Command Injection

Apparently creating posts executes command that are inserted into the content - only caveat is that we have to avoid bad characters - spaces and double quotes (").&#x20;

Content can be also viewed in /archive

Shell has been popped

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

## Member of ADM group&#x20;

Being member of ADM group makes it possible to read logs. Apparently password was typed into wrong field (email). (Password was found by grepping password in apache2 logs and checking results line by line.&#x20;

To find possible usernames to work with the password found, i've checked /etc/passwd and the password worked with shaun.

## WebServer#2 - splunkd

There is another vhost running on port 8089. It was found during initial enumeration but now it is apparent that it works as root.

```
root        1141  0.0  0.3  77664 15944 ?        Ss   15:25   0:00 [splunkd pid=1139] splunkd -p 8089 start [process-runner]
```

After searching for a while it became clear that shaun's credentials work for that service and there was also an exploit found ([https://github.com/cnotin/SplunkWhisperer2](https://github.com/cnotin/SplunkWhisperer2))

Running PySplunkWhisperer2\_remote.py setting up credentials results in an reverse shell which also proves that that vulnerability can be exploited remotely
