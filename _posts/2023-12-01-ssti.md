# Intro
This post/writeup is all about the Clickjacking Vulnerabilities.

I'll be using primarily [Portswigger Web Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection) Labs, but i do intent do throw other labs and writeups here as well.

To learn more on the topic, please visit the article linked above at Portswigger's.

# Basic server-side template injection
> This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to the unsafe construction of an ERB template.
> 
> To solve the lab, review the ERB documentation to find out how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.

When we start the lab and open a product, we would see following request which is obviously being reflected:

After checking the documentation for ERB templating (Ruby), this synthax should return `49`: ==> `<%= 7*7 %>`.

As seen above, we do get `49` reflected. Now we need to delete a file `morale.txt`.

This synthax runs commands on the system:

```html
<%= system("ls -la /home") %>
```

# Basic server-side template injection (code context)
> This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to the way it unsafely uses a Tornado template. To solve the lab, review the Tornado documentation to discover how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.

Let us log in:

```

When i've ran the request above, error occured when sending comming in a blog post, but when i changed the parameter to `blog-post-author-display=7*7`, the `49` is shown instead of the `Name`:

This one was more tricky to exploit as os lib is not imported and we have to do it first. This is the final payload:

```html
blog-post-author-display=user.name}}{%25+import+os+%25}{{os.system('rm%20/home/carlos/morale.txt')
```
