# Intro
This post/writeup is all about the Clickjacking Vulnerabilities.

I'll be using primarily [Portswigger Web Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection) Labs, but i do intent do throw other labs and writeups here as well.

To learn more on the topic, please visit the article linked above at Portswigger's.

As seen above, we do get `49` reflected. Now we need to delete a file `morale.txt`.

This synthax runs commands on the system:
