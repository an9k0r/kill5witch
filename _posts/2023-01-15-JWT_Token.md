# Intro
This post/writeup is all about the JWT Token Attaxks.

I'll be using primarily [Portswigger Web Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt) Labs, but i do intent do throw other labs and writeups here as well.

To learn more on the topic, please visit the article linked above at Portswigger's.

We should take a look at JWT token.

I'll be using `JWT Editor` Burp Extension

![picture 2](/assets/images/52b5947600ae493909dfb15a1112239824435198cfad100ec2f37f02ee347bc6.png)  

We can intercept and simply change `wiener` to `administrator` as signature isn't being verified

We can reach the `/admin` panel where we can delete user `carlos` in order to solve the lab

Alternatively, we could simply change the user on `https://jwt.io` and copy-paste the token.

Same as in the previous lab, spin the lab and login using provided credentials `wiener:peter`.

Let's check the JWT Token using `JWT Editor` in Burp.

![picture 6](/assets/images/2ae0241ea56a8f64cfefb5f4edba11c9a8978fb3df311f5dfded06fe909c0551.png)  

Let's try `none signing algorithm`

![picture 7](/assets/images/aacb1623b354f013d1d340d739c3c5ebdd3ddaaa88d18054d584113bb128fa6a.png)  

Paste the token in the browser and delete `carlos` in order to solve the lab.

![picture 8](/assets/images/349f499862ecff52755130a3915fe37f06a89e61d43feea704288f8d8bda7b8a.png) 

Alternatively we could use `wiener`'s token and run it througt `jwt_tool`

```
jwt_tool eyJraWQiOiJhNjI5OTk2My1jYmIwLTQ0NmMtOTk0YS01MzNjZjk5MWNiMjAiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJwb3J0c3dpZ2dlciIsInN1YiI6IndpZW5lciIsImV4cCI6MTY3Mzg5ODY5NH0.dSMupWeq6dJxk9WOqDjW9Hv2wrOs2y29fhig24pwroH6vI8gmO6lU-Zniz3T8eCrvpGz8Bs36RK0PWKxTcsWfvI68LMbwuud9pmHwg5hpTGMXphZptTYTmh_T1Cu-J9gzRJVLvYkKobseJ_z5PISh5f0nTNuF5QIpV7nZ2s-bLD7OxrwNl3VTjDqUQOIS13l9Xn-jPs28IyQiskI8IbOe4EpRUDfc8179Xa-w5l4LV_QD3rQcDyybq6fvkow6kw_tE01G2Ck4qTAQxImXcM-nIICW-vwssqZQYVCZ6hLui-IKbMgnssQOayEhwC1Vqg2FEQr0WN8uQMEKdZrjvasJw -pc sub -pv administator -I -X a
```

`-pc` and `-pv` will change payload value from `wiener` to `administrator` and `-X a` means attack - `algo:none`

# JWT authentication bypass via weak signing key
> This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. It uses an extremely weak secret key to both sign and verify tokens. This can be easily brute-forced using a [wordlist of common secrets](https://github.com/wallarm/jwt-secrets/blob/master/jwt.secrets.list).

>

This one i'll make it short as it's relatively simple.
We login using ´wiener:peter´. Run hashcat against the hash

```
hashcat hash ../wordlists/jwt.secrets.list -m 16500
```

Use either `https://jwt.io` or jwt_tool and sign the token back using found secret key.

```
jwt_tool eyJraWQiOiIxZDlkNWZhMS0xMWRjLTQzZWMtYjZjZC1jOGYxM2YxOTk2ZTIiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJwb3J0c3dpZ2dlciIsInN1YiI6IndpZW5lciIsImV4cCI6MTY3Mzg5OTcxM30.hUWLKQ6Fyrc1iywdg2Iv8_DFmzal7cvR3OD1UbS5mRg -pc sub -pv administrator -I -p secret1 -S hs256
```

Exchange the token new one and delete `carlos`

# JWT authentication bypass via jwk header injection
> This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. The server supports the jwk parameter in the JWT header. This is sometimes used to embed the correct verification key directly in the token. However, it fails to check whether the provided key came from a trusted source.
> 
> To solve the lab, modify and sign a JWT that gives you access to the admin panel at /admin, then delete the user carlos.
> 
> You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

As in previous lab, login using `wiener:peter` and intercept the request.

![picture 9](/assets/images/e713168ac32f2e5be7b438a6c475679a239fdce7806e6d9ac743b42dcde29f0e.png)  

Choose Embeded JWK in `Attack`, but bear in mind that you need to have generated RSA key before that. Change `wiener` to `administrator`.

![picture 10](/assets/images/8fe0dc4c4cd4e4dc8690d5d851e8a562678beef3c4961d9ad9d3c1bf66106f21.png)  

When using the new token, `/admin` should be reachable where we can delete `carlos` in order to solve the lab.

![picture 11](/assets/images/eb12764cbec4ab87e78940f976751cf2c83a78ed179ae2db44fa13db8fb3d95d.png)  


# JWT authentication bypass via jku header injection
> This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. The server supports the jku parameter in the JWT header. However, it fails to check whether the provided URL belongs to a trusted domain before fetching the key.
> 
> To solve the lab, forge a JWT that gives you access to the admin panel at /admin, then delete the user carlos.

We will copy public key of our RSA certificate which will be used for signing.

![picture 15](/assets/images/e6ae8c73138833d49c0704ec2b01b83481b2aeebe60dd377a087e94510c0802a.png)  

This is what our exploit server will serve. We have copied public key.

![picture 16](/assets/images/390c9aa08e8f72e08d8834f477b9efc5bc7893794ebbc9ef9bc3e252db0b0822.png)  

We need to add `jku` header which points to our exploit server.

![picture 14](/assets/images/3e0351b4c54fd4b1f8f5302c0dd1bae52cd9f70d750b8936681adcac4ef69bea.png)  


Now we can delete user `carlos` in order to solve the lab.

![picture 13](/assets/images/e2b32bc00079024910fd94731a952deb332ff054e27b121b74351ca3455239a3.png)  

We can also verify that requests have been made towards our exploit server.

![picture 12](/assets/images/3ff74c24927f6630c06c99426d575b5fd39cc5bd6bd6b9258300882457cfaa05.png)  

# JWT authentication bypass via kid header path traversal
> This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. In order to verify the signature, the server uses the kid parameter in JWT header to fetch the relevant key from its filesystem.
> 
> To solve the lab, forge a JWT that gives you access to the admin panel at /admin, then delete the user carlos.
> 
> You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

As in previous labs, login using `wiener:peter` and check the Token in `JWT Editor`:

![picture 17](/assets/images/e6a6c6567c60177f14387e4137a4fb734c43fc4642de8deea61a9ec4f01d1c7a.png)  

Admin interface is still only available to administrator

![picture 18](/assets/images/c9bfde721ee953e12f2f1dc6b4724a429d164cc39f56729febed882e52fb61d9.png)  

For this attack we'll need `Symmetric Key` ready from `JWT Editor`. 

![picture 19](/assets/images/c37f2adf7aba95768e1b700e714d8459570661b178e15d67c14f92fac0a349e1.png)  

Exchange the `k` value with `AA==` (this is not necesarry for an attack, but it's just workaround for Burp)

Change the `kid` and sub payload/header values accordingly.

![picture 21](/assets/images/b5f5fb5d45826697790d19232857d7e764b646b5f68049ed6686b979eef10e1c.png)  

Now exchange the token and delete `carlos` in order to finish the lab.

Make sure you check this article first so the lab actually makes sense ==> https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/algorithm-confusion

We can login using `wiener:peter` and we'd notice that JWT is hardened however there's an endpoint exposing a JWK set containing single public key:

![picture 22](/assets/images/70808173319319c324446a5d454256934d7c5788f08b13839ceb24f926e12464.png)  

Using that public key we'll create a new RSA key, so copy the key into `New RSA Key` in `Burp's JWT Editor Keys`:

![picture 23](/assets/images/ce0caf45dcd1c494dfe5d9a0e665d1768171952fc6e38937a2dfaa175af22da1.png)  

Save the RSA key and copy the public key in PEM and encode it using BASE64 (we can use decoder).

We can now create `New Symmetric Key` and save the base64 encoded PEM public key into `k` !

![picture 24](/assets/images/0759b65cac24d6ae07810c259943d827497346881d43515469aa50e1ddcd1301.png)  

This is now original request if we've logged in and tried access `/admin`:

![picture 25](/assets/images/54edf88e4fe36602b4360648bae506f2c184d696cc0c0c7e957af0bf90e8c6c3.png)  

We have to change `alg` to `HS256` and `sub` to `administrator` and sign the token using `Symmetric Key` we've created moments before.

![picture 26](/assets/images/02a8a9b5f7dd8af30d34e27db895124221c83c30b08cd4603f285ccfa6ee08c2.png)  

Exchange the token and delete `carlos` in order to solve the lab.

Make sure you check this article first so the lab actually makes sense ==> https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/algorithm-confusion

For this lab we'll need two valid tokens, so we'll login 2 times to get 2 different tokens for single user.

Both tokens will be piped into a tool `sign2n`. The reason why i'm not using docker container from `portswigger/sig2n` is because it does not work out of the box for me and basically does the same as https://github.com/silentsignal/rsa_sign2n/tree/release/standalone. Choose either one.

![picture 27](/assets/images/271498e7b7de17ceeb591a11c98f6e4c7150656ff10d790fc7e5bdde67220410.png)  

First token worked and i was logged in as `wiener`.

I've used `cat` on the `x509.pem` key and piped it into `bash64`.

Now create a new `Symmetric Key` and exchange the `k` bash64 encoded value above.

Change the `alg` and `sub` and sign the token using `Symmetric Key` that was generated above.

Delete `carlos` to solve the lab.
