**The Security Operations Center at Defense Superior are monitoring a customer’s email gateway and network traffic (Crimeson LLC).**
# Scenario

# PCAP Analysis
## Export Objects (HTML)
Let us open the `LAB.pcap` in Wireshark and let's export HTML objects with`Export Objects > HTML`
![](/assets/images/2022-04-08-19-15-05.png)

We can see `pdf.bat` file that's being downloaded, which apperas to be our initial payload file
> What is the full filename of the initial payload file?: INVOICE_2021937.pdf.bat

![](/assets/images/2022-04-08-19-15-15.png)

This information can be found in the HTTP header. I've used this python's module a lot, otherwise google would tell it is `SimpleHTTPServer`
> What is the name of the module used to serve the malicious payload?: SimpleHTTPServer
> Analysing the traffic, what is the attacker's IP address?: 192.168.1.9
> Now that you know the payload name and the module used to deliver the malicious files, what is the URL that was embedded in the malicious email?: http://192.168.1.9:443/INVOICE_2021937.pdf.bat

## Decoding in CyberChef
Follow the Packet as HTTP Stream

> Find the PowerShell launcher string (you don’t need to include the base64 encoded script): powershell -noP -sta -w 1 -enc 

To see what that obfuscated command is all about, let's throw it into CyberChef
![](/assets/images/2022-04-08-19-15-55.png)

So i used Base64 + Regex. Copied that back into Input and apply `Generic Code Beautify`

> What is the default user agent being used for communications? Mozila 5/0
> You are seeing a lot of HTTP traffic. What is the name of a process where malware communicates with a central server asking for instructions at set time intervals?beaconing

## Continuing with PCAP Analysis
Use either `Find in Packet` or use http Filter and scroll.

> What is the URI containing ‘login’ that the victim machine is communicating to?: /login/process.php
> What is the name of the popular post-exploitation framework used for command-and-control communication?: Empire
### Checking for exfiltration
So we know the Attacker's IP. Lets filter that out and check `Protocol Hierarchy Statistics`
![](/assets/images/2022-04-08-19-16-47.png)

We can see that basically there's only HTTP and ICMP where ICMP definately stands out. So let's apply ICMP as filter
![](/assets/images/2022-04-08-19-16-59.png)

To check what's being sent into requests (we are assuming exfiltration) we need to use TSHARK. So let's use it and filter only Requests, outputing data
`tshark.exe -r C:\Users\BTLOTest\Desktop\Investigation\LAB.pcap -Y "icmp.type==8" -T fields -e data` 
Since this outputs HEX, let's put output into the file
```
C:\Program Files\Wireshark>tshark.exe -r C:\Users\BTLOTest\Desktop\Investigation\LAB.pcap -Y "icmp.t
```
Copy and paste that into CyberChef and apply. `From Hex` `From Base64` and `Regex`
