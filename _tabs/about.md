Hello and welcome to my blog!

My name is Luka and i'm a husband, father, musician, blue teamer with passion for penetration testing among other things.

I try to stay sharp on my CyberSec skills by mostly doing either CTFs or pursuing certifications where primary goal is to learn.
I have sucessfuly passed OSCP, OSWE, OSEP, eCPPTv2 certifications so far and finished Dante and Cybernetics ProLabs on [Hack the Box](https://app.hackthebox.com/).

Besides being active on [BlueTeamLabsOnline](https://blueteamlabs.online/) and [Hack the Box](https://app.hackthebox.com/) i'm curretly working on finishing Burp Suite Pratictioner Path and refreshing my WebApp skills at [Web Security Academy at Portswigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security).

I plan to have a go at [PNPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/) Certification, hopefully until the end of 2022.

Mid-term goals:
- Finish OSED from [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp301-osed/)
- Run a Half-marathon

From time to time i intent to post guides from tools or techniques that i have found useful.
