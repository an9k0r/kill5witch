Hey there!

I won't spend much words to introduce myself, you can just follow me on LinkedIn or Twitter if you find the content useful... My Name is Luka (yeah, that's also a old song), and i don't live on live on the second floor... Ok let's get serious now;) ! ~~I am at the time of writing on a mission of getting OSCP certified, but in a fact i want to go further and concentrate on Web Application Security~~. (Update on 4.6.2021) I am OSCP, OSWE, eCPPTv2 Certified and working towards OSEP Certification from Offensive Security.

I plan to document writeups from platforms like hackthebox.eu and tryhackme from boxes that are special in some way. I will however always try to keep it simple.

From time to time i intent to post guides from tools or techniques that i have found useful.
