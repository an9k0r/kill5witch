Hello and welcome to my blog!

Just a quick introduction.
My name is Luka and i'm currently working as a blue teamer. I switched from working with security/network devices into cyber security in mid 2021. In order for that to happen i've solved many HTB and THM machines and pursued courses and certifications (in order to learn!) like eCPPT, OSCP, OSWE, OSEP.

Even as a blue teamer i stillsolve Hack the Box boxes for which i'll be dropping Writeups here for machines that i've done AND found worthy having an actual writeup/reference in future.
I'm also active on [BlueTeamLabsOnline](https://blueteamlabs.online/) and i'll try to publish writeups of retired machines as well.

From time to time i intent to post guides from tools or techniques that i have found useful.
