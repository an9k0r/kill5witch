Hello and welcome to my blog!

Luka here, husband, father, musician and blue teamer who does as much penetration testing as possible and enjoys it. 
I try to stay sharp on my CyberSec skills by mostly doing either CTFs or pursuing certifications where primary goal is learning(!) and not "a piece of paper".
I have sucessfuly passed OSCP, OSWE, OSEP, eCPPTv2 certifications and finished Dante and Cybernetics ProLabs on [Hack the Box](https://app.hackthebox.com/).

Besides also being active on [BlueTeamLabsOnline](https://blueteamlabs.online/) and [Hack the Box](https://app.hackthebox.com/) i currently work on CBBH Skill Path on Hackthebox Academy.
I am not rushing that certification but rather taking it slowly and cross-learn same topics using [Web Security Academy at Portswitter](https://portswigger.net/web-security) and `The Web Application Hacker's Handbook, 2nd Edition` book. Plan is to drop notes on single attack group here as i move forward.

After CBBH, i plan to have a go on [PNPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/) Certification, hopefully until the end of 2022.

From time to time i intent to post guides from tools or techniques that i have found useful.
